What is this?

This is a project that I'm building in order to learn more about Golang and networking
It basically is just a Pomodoro timer that two people can share together and help each other be acountable

What do you think you learn with this?

I want to learn moe about the Language itself, how to build a bit more complex things than I have done so far and
also want to learn more about Networking. 
I think Golang is a great language so far and it can only be benefitical if I learn it more
